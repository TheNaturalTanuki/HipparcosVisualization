# HipparcosVisualization
3D star visualization, as described by the Hipparcos star catalogue.

At the origin of this project: I think it would be valuable to have a way of visiting our star neighborhood in a 3D environment. And Unity DOTS ECS is around the corner. It's a match made in the stars! ;D
